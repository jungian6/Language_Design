The following Repo got me 100% on my Language Design Assignment :)

How to use this language
-----------------------
1. Make sure you followed all instructions in Build.txt
2. Run Shell.py
3. in the shell, you can execute commands or run scripts
4. To run a script, type RUN("Scripts/YourScriptName.txt")
5. To execute a command, type the command and press enter (e.g. PRINT "Hello World")

Commands must be in the following format:
   COMMAND_NAME a = b + c
    where COMMAND_NAME is the name of the command, a is the variable name, and b and c are the values

Please Note: Commands must be separated by a newline.

Example Commands
----------------
PRINT "Hello World"
VAR a = 5
VAR b = 10
VAR c = a + b
PRINT c


Example Shell Commands
-----------------------
>>> VAR A = 50
50
>>> IS_NUM(A)
True
>>>
